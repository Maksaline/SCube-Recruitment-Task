# scube_task

## Overview
This task was given to me by SCube technologies for their recruitment process.

## Figma Links
- [Figma Editor link](https://www.figma.com/design/jTtgocjubnXU8YFJl3IGQg/SCUBE-App-Task?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=M5BT5thwC58847NP-0)
- [Figma Prototype Link](https://www.figma.com/proto/jTtgocjubnXU8YFJl3IGQg/SCUBE-App-Task?node-id=1-70&t=M5BT5thwC58847NP-0&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=1%3A48)


## Repository Structure
As the project was simple and did not require any complex architecture, so I followed this structure for my ease.
```
├── data/
├── model/
├── screens/
└── main.dart
```

## Success
- **I have successfully completed the task that fully matches with the Figma Prototype, even the tiny details**

## Considerations
Some assets were incompatible for svg format as they contained <image> tag with a link. For these assets, I used the png format that somewhat lowered the asset quality. But for the rest of the assets, I used the svg format.


## Things I Avoided
- Didn't add any launcher icon
